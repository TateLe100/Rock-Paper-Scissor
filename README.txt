Program: Basic Rock Paper Sissors Program that will involve Html, JavaScript, 
and CSS. 

The first iteration of this game that will be created will only focus on more 
of the back-end of the site. The first iteration will entirely be used in the 
console. 

I will now begin to write out my plan and pseudocode for the functionality. 

RULES 
1. Rock beats scissors
2. Scissors beat paper
3. Paper beats rock.

PLAN 
1. user will pick a number between 1-3. 
2. computer will randomly pick a number between 1-3
3. test between the two and see who won.
